# AyoAyoGame-mancala
A project to test my understanding of game theory, and decision theory.

This project is a simple mancala game written in JavaFx. I wrote this project back in February 2015.

Your are free to use the code or build upon it, all I ask is that you at least give attribution to the author [ my humble self :) ]



<h3>About The Game [How To Play It]:</h3>

Ayoayo is a Nigerian mancala game which is played by the Yoruba ethic group in Nigeria. It should not be confused with Oware, which is also sometimes called "Ayoayo".

Ayoayo is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. Each pits contains four(4) seeds(default, but can be increased to seven(7) from the settings menu) at the start.

At the turn of a player, S/He takes the content of one of his round pits and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.

The move ends when the last seed falls in an empty hole.

If during a playing turn the content of any hole on either sides of the board equals the starting seeds(default is four(4) seeds) and the player is still playing his turn, the seeds in that hole will be taken and added to the score of the owner of the hole.

If the last seeds falls in a hole and the total content of that hole equals the starting seeds(default is four(4) seeds), then the content of that hole is claimed by the player who played the turn, irrespective of whose side the hole resides.

If at the end of the game(only four seeds left), a player who begins his turn when his/her opponent has no seeds to play should make a move as not to pass seeds to his/her opponent if possible. If that is possible, then the player with seeds remaining captures all of the seeds for himself/herself. In this game, one wants to have his opponent to run out of seeds first, but s/he needs to arrange his/hers so that s/he cannot pass any to the other side.

The player who captures the most seeds wins the game.
